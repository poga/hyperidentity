# Hyperidentity

**Bring-Your-Own-Data** to the web

[login.withdat.com](http://login.withdat.com)(currently 404) is an experiment about letting users create *identities* and login to services with them.

An identity is a dat archive containing data he/she want to share with that service. If the service want to store data, just create a dat archive and let user [link](https://github.com/poga/hyperdrive-ln) it to its identity archive.

Services can setup its own public peer to make user's data accessable when the user is offline.

We're going to provide a menubar app like 1password and allow one-click login with it.
